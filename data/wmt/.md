The WMT (Workshop on Machine Translation) dataset is not included in this repository
due to its large size and licensing restrictions.

You can download the dataset from the official WMT website:

For this project, the Russian–English parallel corpus was used (news-commentary v18.1.).
Please follow the official instructions on the website to obtain and preprocess the data.
